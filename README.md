# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

This is a simple command-line game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 50. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It also keeps track of the number of attempts the user takes to guess the correct number.

## How It Works

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 50.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program informs the user whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
- When the user guesses correctly, the program displays the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
